<h4 class="blogtitle">A Traveller's Sojourn</h4>
<div class="ImgDescription">
<p>
I was away from blogging since I found my narrative terribly boring, when I read back after years.  With my new website up, I thought of writing again under the cozy cover of anonymity.  Last year was wonderful, after all the madness at work, I was sent to US on a few months business trip, and my location a village in the suburbs of Chicago.  The village where I stayed had no public transport, taxi takes anywhere between 30 min – 1 hour to arrive at door step, and there is no guarantee that the driver will not mug and throw you out of taxi.  If you don’t own a car you’re screwed, and unfortunately I didn’t.  Aren’t these supposed to be basic necessities?  Despite the tarnished image that media had triumphantly painted in peoples mind, I have had trivial problems finding modes to travel in remote villages in India, haven’t awaited taxi’s more than a few minutes after making a booking, above all I get to stay with my family.  In my small lonely world, the priority of last point is increasing exponentially.  After all the hype-gone-wrong and discomforts, there are a few tiny little happenings that made my stay amazingly wonderful and left a lingering memory.  Firstly being away from my desolation, excitation of meeting Eli, Mr & Mrs Kottai (the last time I saw them, they were my classmates and met them near Rainforest, Chennai), followed by visit to NYC and Niagara and the one last thing that I yearn to get back is the church experience and being a part of the church team, although it was for a short time it was a beautiful experience and nothing like what I have had before.
</p>
<p>
Quite a prelude! back to the  point of the story, this narrative is all about the three day trip to NYC and a day’s visit to Niagara falls.  This is also written with the intention that anyone who visits NYC on a 2-3 day trip or Niagara Falls on a 1 days trip can get some information out of this.
</p>
<h4>New York Trip</h4>
<h5>Arriving in NY</h5>
<p>
The planning committee essentially consisted of Eli, Mr & Mrs. Kottai, and my job was to present myself in NYC.  Eli came up with a beautiful looking travel plan.  Here is it:

<p>
This was sent to a cryptographic specialist in MIT to be decrypted.  With results awaited we had a night long discussion that led to me booking a round trip ticket to NYC (ORD, Chicago to LaGuardia-NY), as LaGuardia seemed to be cheaper.  It was an American Airlines flight booked via Kayak.com, that took me to NYC on a Friday night around 9 P.M.  Mr and Mrs Kottai were on their way to pick me up, we then drove to Jersey City and decided to rest in Eli’s room for the night.  We saw that the decrypted results had arrived and we all concurred to Eli’s plans.  The plan was unassailable.  Eli also had tickets booked for Statue of Liberty, although we missed out on the crown ticket.  Below is a snapshot of the ticket.  After a brief discussion that night, we decided to call it a day.

<h5>Day 1</h5>
<p>
Our plan was to start very early next day as we were supposed to be in line for Statue for Liberty at 8 AM.  Everything went by plan and we were in Statue of Liberty.  And Eli essentially being a semi-historian, gave us a concise account of the history of the Statue and Ellis island.  The view across the river and NYC and NJ skyline was stunning (I believe it’s called upper and lower Manhattan):

After this we had to fuel ourselves to move on.  We went to Indian street and had a sumptuous meal.  Following our meal we went on a spree quickly covering Wall Street, Bull, Brooklyn Bridge, Rockefeller center, Empire state (took a while because of long queue.  We also had a photo session here with Mrs. Kottai as light man) and Times Square.  Times Square being our final destination for the night, with our bodies screaming for rest and eye-lids heavy with sleep we returned to Jersey City to rest in Eli’s room.

<h5>Day 2</h5>
<p>
Our plan for the day was Washington DC.  We started very early around 4:30 AM and reached there around 10:00 AM; we stopped on the way for breakfast.  We casually sipped some coffee, strolling around streets after street before reaching our first destination for the day which was The White House.  When I saw Capitol building from a distance, I half expected it to be The White House, a reminder of my weak knowledge on US.  Following this we visited The Washington Monument (Obelisk), Lincoln Memorial and Capitol building.  It started drizzling while walking across Capitol building.  Little did we know that it heralded the arrival of a heavy downpour.  Luckily, we were back in the car and decided to negotiate our way back to NJ through heavy rain and traffic.  While speeding on the freeway someone hinted Burger-Fi for dinner, so we found one nearby few miles out of the freeway and had our dinner.  And now it was Eli’s turn to drive, as Mr Kottai was breathing with half his life.  With heavy down pour blinding our vision the speeds were restricted to no more than 50 MPH.  It was a slow journey back to NJ, when we reached home it was well over 2:00 AM.   We crashed it utter tiredness and woke up late the next day.

<h5>Day 3 - Last day of Trip</h5>
<p>
Nothing grandiose was planned for the day, Eli made me a really good coffee and we planned to visit a nearby mall.  Eli Chose me a t-shirt and two pull-overs from Old Navy.  Somewhere in the mall it got delayed and I was really late for the flight.  I was the last one to board; a few minutes delay would have led me to miss the flight.  Even Picaso had a muse, so was Mr. Kottai entertained by Cortana, whisked through the traffic and managed to put me in airport on time.  I wrote a good-bye message to all, with a smile fighting back tears welling up my eyes (Unfortunately for us who are the stronger of the sexes society has stripped us of our rights to shed tears!).  Still tired with the stressful boarding, laid back on the flight and rested, these were some of my reflections.  
<p>
<ul>
<li>Honda Accord became one of my favourite cars</li>
<li>My stomach does not do pani poori’s</li>
<li>US is slightly hyped and Big Apple is ridiculously hyped</li>
<li>Being late for flight is not so cool as it sounds when others say</li>
<li>Always surround with atleast a few friends who’ll care for us, after all man is a social animal</li>
</ul>
</p>
I wished I can relive these moments, which was the impetus to plan the Niagara trip.

<h4>Niagara Trip</h4>
<div class="ImgDescription">
<p>
Followed by the New York trip we planned a trip to Niagara Falls, one of the most visited tourist destination of the world.  Knowing the infamous public transport in US, I didn’t expect an easy conveyance; nevertheless I didn’t expect it to be this bad either, here’s why... Started mining for ways to reach Niagara and found that there is no easy means to directly reach the falls via public transport.  Once again after a long nights call, the plan for me was to reach Niagara via train, it reaches Dephew, Buffallo from Chicago Amtrack station.  Eli, Mr & Mrs Kottai will reach there in car, also joined by two of their friends, pick me up from Dephew and drive down to Niagara.  When Amtrack reached Dephew, they were still far away, so thought of taking a taxi to Niagara Falls park.  The train journey itself is pretty good and safe to travel; it has a pantry where we can have a bachelor’s breakfast (Bread, corn and coffee), and sink in the quaint track-side scenes.  Getting down in Dephew found that the station was in the midst of nowhere, the normal way to get taxi is to call airport taxi service which was like 15 min drive from the station and they will pick us up from here.  So I waited their arrival chatting with a Japanese tourist cum law student, who was covering places studying their culture and laws.  Their arrival took me through the last hop in reaching Niagara Falls.  Things to remember here, Buffallo has two train stations, one is Dephew and the other one is within the limits of Buffallo city.
</p>
<p>
From miles we were able to see mist rising from the gallons of waters crashing down on the rocks.  We then launched ourselves to quickly cover two of the most important shows, maid of the mist and cave of the winds.  Maid of the mist is essentially the one that takes us midst the Horseshoe Falls, with a trillion gallons of water flowing down towering rocks, it just feels like you are standing on a short platform, shut in a room that’s being continuously filled with water pouring in from all around... but it never gets filled.  A spectacle, that made us realize we are tiny specks of dust in the vast entirety of planet earth.
</p>
<p>
We quickly realized we have lost too much time and rushed to Cave of the winds.  It took us right beneath the Bridal Veil Falls, with waters crashing down on bystanders and flowing down the decking, it’s a sight to get yourself wet (not for me).  We walked out, brushed dry, treated ourselves with coffee and fries and moved on to look around the Niagara rivulets (Didn’t see anything much though!).  After a good dinner in the nearby Punjabi Dhaba, we decided to call it a day.  Eli and Mr. Kottai dropped me in Dephew.  As train streamed off, I bid them good bye and promised I’ll meet them again soon, yet wondering when it’ll be.
</p>
<p>
I never met them again in US.  Thus ended a timeless ephemera in a traveller's sojourn.  Also coming is a brief account of my stay in US...
