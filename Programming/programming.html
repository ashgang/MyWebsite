After a lot of thought, I decided to buy an evaluation board for myself.  After reading through various boards, I finally cornered down to Wandboard from Freescale.  I downloaded wandboards uBoot, Linux kernel and used busybox for rootFS.  This is a brief walk-through of the things I did to get 'prompt'.<br>
Their official website: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wandboard.org/">http://www.wandboard.org/</a>
</p>
<p>
The first step to getting anything running in wandboard to is to buy yourself a wandboard.  I bought mine from Future electronics, its around 10 USD less than else where, and in my experience the support stuff were really patient to tolerate my annoyances.  Moreover they ship anywhere across the globe.  So I recommend get it from them. (Suggestions as if it were a million dollar Lear jet..!) <br>
Here is their link (for those who are lazy enough to search it out in google :P): <a target="_blank" href="http://www.futureelectronics.com/WebsiteLanding.aspx">http://www.futureelectronics.com/WebsiteLanding.aspx</a><br>
<ol>
<li> Search for wandboard after entering their website. </li>
<li> Last information I heard from them is that wandboard is a high demand product.  So you may expect some delays in getting yours.  I got mine when few people knew about it.  So it was shipped quickly. </li>
<li> They make ask you to fill up, sign and send back some forms, since its a restricted product.  Don't be surprised if you see any ridiculous questions in the form. </li>
<li> What you'll get from them is only the board, you will have to get a 5V/2A power adaptor and <b>Null modem cable</b> (not normal serial cable, I made this mistake) for serial port connection to see your console output. </li>
<li> Above all, if you wish to contact me for any technical questions, I would love to assist you from the very little I know.  After all <b>"Human Knowledge Belongs To The World"</b>.  I am able to write this because, there was someone else who thought the same. </li>
<li>Oops! did I forget to provide my e-mail ID...  hmmm... no actually I didn't, you find it out. (Holy cow! what an amazingly difficult task! hahahaha) </li>

<p>Obviously, there are tonnes of blogs explaining this procedure.  And I thought why not add one more to the list, this one being my crappy website. :P</p>
<p>
Before going into any of these make sure you have a cross compiler installed in your host.  Follow this <a href="CrossCmp/CrossCompiler.html">CROSS_COMPILE</a> to do the installation, if you do not have one installed.  If you are my kind of person, who shouts out to the blogger to cut the crap and just give the list of command, I understand your problem, and I think I have a workaround for it.  Every page that has a step by step procedure, is followed by a "list of commands" at last.  Look for it! its for you!</p>
<p>I categorize it into three parts:
<ul>
<li><a href="UBoot/UBoot.html">U-Boot</a></li>
<li><a href="LKernel/LinuxKernel.html">Linux Kernel</a></li>
<li><a href="Busybox/Busybox.html">BusyBox</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
After getting Busybox up and running, Mr. X and myself were discussing what next to explore.  The next idea we had were to do two things:
<ul>
<li>Remove default init of Busybox and replace it with systemd.  Apparently it has to be cross compiled for ARM platform from code.</li>
<li>Try to get pulse audio working in wandboard (Maybe its available, we wanted to do our own, OOPS supporters don't come out bashing with your reinventing cycle theory, learning takes some reinventing.  May be we may also invent something in the process :P)</li>
</ul>
However, when Mr. X started working in systemd, he realized that he will break his SD card slot and power port, before he gets systemd running.  So he was checking if we can load Busybox via NFS.  I joined a bit late here, but somehow I got it working quickly.  Since we work on VMWare player, sometimes its settings does not allow us to get network things working very easily.  And yes, our next venture in the steps of climbing Mt. Everest is to set up NFS, and mirror what Tenzing and Hillary did :P.  That was little too much of bragging, of course we weren't the first to do it.<br>
Here's what I did to get NFS working: <a href="NFS/nfs.html">Follow Me!</a>
