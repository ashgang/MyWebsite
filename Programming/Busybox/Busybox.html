<p>
For a long time I was stuck with U-Boot and Linux kernel.  I was happy enough to see a kernel panic, when it does not find init.  I never wanted to put a rootFS and check out.  Above all I had this very good excuse, my previous laptop that I used for initial compilation of UBoot and kernel blew up :)  Considering the fact that my love is gone now, I had to find a new gf.  After some thought, I bought a 64-bit windows 8 laptop, and unfortunately I wasn't able to install Linux.  Then came the VMWare thought, although I was never happy to work on a VMWare based Linux machine.
</p>
<p>
However I never really did anything for a while.  Fortunately, in my case, I saw that there are a few people who share my interest.  And his name is Mr. X.  Mr. X was looking to buy a new board, and I shared my opinion on wandboard.  By this time wandboard guys already had a quad core board in their line-up.  And with no further thought Mr. X got himself a wandboard quad.  And in our discussion, we thought we must go further and try atleast a small rootFS.  That was the starting point of putting Busybox for rootFS.  He also shared his idea of mounting Busybox via NFS, but that would be a separate topic on how I got NFS working.  You can find Mr. X's e-mail id in the disclaimer, if you wish to ask him questions :) <br> <br>
<b>Moral of the story:</b> Always have people around you, who share your interest.  That ensures, when you become complacent there is someone to kick your butt, and wake you up!

<h3>Busybox compilation and flashing</h3>
<ol>
<li>mkdir busybox</li>
<li>cd busybox</li>
<li>Get the latest busybox tarball from here http://www.busybox.net/downloads/, and untar it to the directory <br>
>> tar -xjvf busybox-1.22.1.tar.bz2 </li>
<li>Move into the directory where its untarred.  In this case, it must be: <br>
>> cd busybox-1.22.1</li>
<li>>> make defconfig<br>
Note that I am not setting the ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE variables, since its always set in my .bashrc.  One more advantage of doing it this way</li>
<li>>> make</li>
<li>>> make install</li>
<li>After this you will find and a directory called _install which has the minimalistic file system structure</li>
<li>Create the following directories:<br>
>> cd _install<br>
>> mkdir dev <br>
>> mkdir proc <br>
>> mkdir sys <br>
>> mkdir -p etc/init.d <br>
>> vim etc/inittab <br>
copy the following:<br>
<code>
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS <br>
::askfirst:/bin/sh <br>
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot <br>
::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a <br>
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r <br>
::restart:/sbin/init <br>
</code>
</li>
<li>Write this down in the etc/fstab: <br>
<code>
proc     /proc proc     defaults 0 0 <br>
sysfs    /sys  sysfs    defaults 0 0 <br>
devtmpfs /dev  devtmpfs defaults 0 0 <br>
</code>
</li>
<li>etc/init.d/rcS must contain this, which is called from inittab <br>
<code>
#!/bin/sh <br>
mount -a <br>
</code>
</li>
<li>Provide execute permissions for rcS: <br>
>> chmod +x etc/init.d/rcS <br>
</li>
<li>U-boot will generally load kernel from first partition and root file system from second partition.  Obviously, you can change this.  However in my case, I just created 2 partition, allowing enough space in the beginning for U-boot to reside.  I did it using GParted. </li>
<li>Copy the contents of the _install folder to the second partition, and you are done. </li>
<li>Insert the SD card to your wandboard, and you will still see kernel panic.  hahaha! The error will be init not found.  Feel like hitting me...  hahah! you are in front of a computer screen remember!  Anyway, with all the anxious anger mixed emotions you feel now, scratch your head and think for a while before moving to next step.</li>
<li>At this juncture I would like to announce to the world my heart felt thanks to Mr. X.  When I was seriously annoyed enough to go lookout and find the issue, he was the one who pointed out the reason.  And the reason is this, the default config of busybox is to compile as dynamic.  This requires Glibc to be cross compiled and installed in target (in busybox _install folder), to pull the dependencies during run time.  You can change this to static compilation before make'ing busybox using the menuconfig. </li>
<li>Now you will be able to boot up and see prompt.  However this is not what we want.  Busybox must be dynamically linked, to have your first "Hello World" C program in busybox, using normal compilation (without compiling it as static). </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Compiling and installing GlibC into busybox: </h3>
<ol>
<li>Get the source as a tarball:<br>
>> wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/glibc-2.19.tar.gz </li>
<li>Unzip the contents: <br>
>> tar -xzf glibc-2.19.tar.gz</li>
<li>Make a build directory, that you can use to build glibc and move into the directory: <br>
>> mkdir glibc-build<br>
>> cd glibc-build</li>
<li>Configure glic for compilation: <br>
>> ../glibc-2.19/configure arm-linux-gnueabi --target=arm-linux-gnueabi --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --prefix= --enable-add-ons</li>
<li>Make glibc and do a make install in the path of your rootFS.  Note that building glic will take sometime. <br>
>> make <br>
>> make install install_root=/home/Desktop/wandboard/rootFS</li>
<li>Your busybox is ready for copying to SD card.  Happy Wandboarding!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note the directory of installation of glibc is not busybox _install dorectory.  Generally after compiling busybox, I copy the contents of _install directory of busybox to the above rootFS directory and then create all the sub-directories required here.  So, I directly installed glibc into this path.  It makes it easy for me to copy this directory to SD card or provide this path if loaded via NFS.  Any changes in the actual compilation directories, can be finalized and copied here.  Did you stumble upon the word NFS! Yes! that will be the next topic of discussion.
