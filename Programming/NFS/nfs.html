<h3>NFS server installation and configuration in PC</h3>
I use Ubuntu as host, so this is what I did to install and configure nfs server
<ol>
<li>sudo apt-get install rpcbind nfs-kernel-server --fix-missing</li>
<li>After installation, NFS was automatically started</li>
<li>Include this line in /etc/exports as below.  Give <br>
>> sudo /etc/exports <br>
else it will not allow to save the file in ubuntu. <br>
- /home/Wonky/Desktop/wandboard/RootFS 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)<br>
- /home/Wonky/Desktop/wandboard/RootFS - This is the location of my rootFS in my host <br>
- 192.168.1.0 - Is the IP of my board to allow connection to rootFS <br>
- 24 and the rest - I have no idea, check it yourself.  Whatever it is this works. :) </li>
<li>After modification in /etc/exports you have to restart nfs server.<br>
>> service nfs-kernel-server restart</li>
<li>That's it! we're done with everything to be done in host. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Configuring U-Boot to load Busybox via NFS</h3>
Everything to be enabled in U-Boot and kernel was already there by default when I tried.  Only thing what I did was the following, to get Busybox via NFS.
<ol>
<li>Load flattened device tree<br>
>> run loadfdt </li>
<li>Load zImage<br>
>> run loadzImage </li>
<li>Modify the mmcroot and mmcrootfstype to NFS <br>
>> setenv mmcroot /dev/nfs<br>
>> setenv mmcrootfstype nfs</li>
<li>This is the most important step, and it took me some time to figure this out <br>
>> setenv bootargs console=${console},${baudrate} ${optargs} root=${mmcroot} rootfstype=${mmcrootfstype} nfsroot=192.168.1.1:/home/Wonky/Desktop/wandboard/RootFS ip=192.168.1.2:192.168.1.1:192.168.1.5:255.255.255.0:ubuntu rootdelay=2 </li>
<li>You may or may not have the root delay, from my part I saw no use of it.  Now start the kernel<br>
>> run mmcbootdefault </li>
<li>It might take a while to mount and load rootFS via NFS.  Be patient. </li>
<li>If it fails, try to check the kernel arguments from U-Boot that is printed somewhere around first 10 line when kernel loads. </li>
<li>If everything is correct try to check your connections.  Try to ping your host from U-Boot (note for this ipaddr env must be set).  Try to ping your target from the host.  Ping should work from both sides without any issues. </li>
<li>For those who have your Linux host in VMWare player, hahahah you might have to do some annoying network configuration and bridging steps, before it works. </li>
<li>For those of you, you will see that ping from target to host works normally (U-Boot will say host alive!).  But your ping from host to target will fails and timeout.  Reason, your connection might not be bridged from windows to VMWare.  I had this issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>
<b>Statutory warning:</b> This is just the way I got it working.  There may be 100 other ways, don't come bashing at me with your ways.  If you can figure it out, do it yourself.  I agree, this is no rocket science.
