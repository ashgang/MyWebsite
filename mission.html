<h4>About how we should work</h3>
<blockquote>
The heights by great men reached and kept, <br>
Were not attained by sudden flight, <br>
But they, while their companions slept, <br>
Were toiling upwards in the night.
</blockquote>
- by
<i>Henry W. Longfellow</i>

<h4>About how we should live (I am not really sure how I bumped into this quote. But it just hit the nail on the head about the purpose of our life!)</h3>
<blockquote>
I expect to pass through this world but once.<br>
Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now.<br>
Let me not defer or neglect it for I shall not pass this way again.
