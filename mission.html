<h4><a id="AbtWork">About how we should work<a/></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
We have not wings, we cannot soar;<br>
But we have feet to scale and climb<br>
By slow degrees, by more and more,<br>
The cloudy summits of our time.<br>
</p>
<p>
The mighty pyramids of stone<br>
That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,<br>
When nearer seen, and better known,<br>
Are but gigantic flights of stairs.<br>
</p>
<p>
The distant mountains, that uprear<br>
Their solid bastions to the skies,<br>
Are crossed by pathways, that appear<br>
As we to higher levels rise.<br>
</p>
<p>
The heights by great men reached and kept, <br>
Were not attained by sudden flight, <br>
But they, while their companions slept, <br>
Were toiling upwards in the night.
</p>

<h4><a id="AbtLife">About how we should live (I am not really sure how I bumped into this quote. But it just hit the nail on the head about the purpose of our life!)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
I expect to pass through this world but once.<br>
Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now.<br>
Let me not defer or neglect it for I shall not pass this way again.
