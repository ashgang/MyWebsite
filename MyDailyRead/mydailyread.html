<h4>Fire Balloons - Janapese weapons of WWII</h4>
<p>

</p>
<p>
A fire balloon (風船爆弾, fūsen bakudan, lit. "balloon bomb"), or Fu-Go, was a weapon launched by Japan during World War II. A hydrogen balloon with a load varying from a 12-kilogram (26 lb) incendiary to one 15 kg (33 lb) antipersonnel bomb and four 5 kg (11 lb) incendiary devices attached, they were designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean and wreak havoc on Canadian and American cities, forests, and farmland.
</p>
<p>
The balloons were relatively ineffective as weapons but were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II.
</p>
<p>
Between November 1944 and April 1945, Japan launched over 9,300 fire balloons. About 300 balloon bombs were found or observed in North America, killing six people and causing a small amount of damage.
</p>
<p>
Similar, but cruder, balloons were also used by Britain to attack Germany between 1942 and 1944.

<h4>BSAA Star Dust incident:</h4>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Star Dust was a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian airliner which crashed into Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes on 2 August 1947, during a flight from Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile. A comprehensive search of a wide area (including what is now known to have been the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and occupants remained unknown for over 50 years. An investigation in 2000 determined the crash was caused by weather-related factors, but until then speculation had included theories of international intrigue, intercorporate sabotage and even abduction by aliens.
</p>
<p>
In the late 1990s, pieces of wreckage from the missing aircraft began to emerge from the glacial ice. It is now assumed that the crew became confused as to their exact location while flying at high altitudes through the (then poorly understood) jet stream. Mistakenly believing they had already cleared the mountain tops, they started their descent when they were in fact still behind cloud-covered peaks, and Star Dust crashed into Mount Tupungato, killing all aboard and burying itself in snow and ice.
</p>
<p>
The last word in Star Dust's final Morse code transmission to Santiago airport, "STENDEC", was received by the airport control tower four minutes prior to its planned landing and repeated twice; it has never been satisfactorily explained.

<h4>Burke & Hare Murder Dolls:</h4>
<p>
<img src="Images/Burke&HareMurderDolls.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Just a few years after the “Anatomy Murderers” Burke and Hare were apprehended in Edinburgh, two boys discovered these tiny dolls, each nested into a miniature coffin hidden away in the city park.
</p>
<p>
At first theories on the dolls' significance ranged from witchcraft to child’s toys, but eventually it began to seem that the 17 tiny figures could be effigies for the 17 murder victims a decade earlier.
</p>
<p>
Between 1827-1828 William Burke and William Hare lured in and murdered their lodgers in a scheme to provide fresh bodies to the local anatomy school. Dr. Robert Knox, a brilliant and well-known local anatomy lecturer, purchased the bodies and most likely knew that something was a bit suspicious about his supply chain.

<h4>Jim Thorpe:</h4>
<p>

</p>
<p>
He is considered as one of the most versatile athletes of 20th century.  He won olympic gold with record timing wearing only shoes that he picked up from garbage that did not fit him well, so he wore extra socks.  It is widely regarded that he was discriminated because of his Indian-American ancestry.
